These scripts were written to maintain consistent user credentials in computer
classroom (cluster). LDAP turned out to be an overkill for an environment,
where the users set up passwords once in a few months and then just want to
have the same password on every node.

pwsend.py can be run as a deamon on the server, where the users change their
passwords. It listens for connections from the local network and sends content
of passwd, shadow and group files, when requested.

pwreceive.py can be run periodically as a cron job in the terminals, so that it
updates local files with data from the server.

Set up and operation:
* symmetric key encryption is used; generate private key and put it in both scripts as secretKey
* to avoid heavy traffic, the pwreceive.py script uses small random delay before the connection is done
* Only entries for PIDs in the range [1000,65000] are exchanged.
